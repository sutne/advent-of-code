[Advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

All parts are self-contained in their own file, with the exception of utils for reading/writing files.

I have attempted to visualize the output for each part by writing output files with relevant information for each line alongside the line itself, which is also very convenient when debugging.
